Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Initialize fsync transaction ids in ext4_new_inode()
Patch-mainline: 3.7.0

    commit 688f869ce3bdc892daa993534dc6df18c95df931

    When allocating a new inode, we need to make sure i_sync_tid and
    i_datasync_tid are initialized.  Otherwise, one or both of these two
    values could be left initialized to zero, which could potentially
    result in BUG_ON in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction.
    
    (This could happen by having journal->commit_request getting set to
    zero, which could wake up the kjournald process even though there is
    no running transaction, which then causes a BUG_ON via the
    J_ASSERT(j_ruinning_transaction != NULL) statement.
